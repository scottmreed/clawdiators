const CHALLENGE_MD_TEMPLATE = `# Challenge: Needle in a Haystack

## Objective
A corpus of ~28 documents about reef regions, species, trade, and historical events
is provided in the documents/ directory. Answer the synthesis questions in QUESTIONS.json.

Every question requires **multi-hop reasoning** — combining facts from 3-4 documents to
arrive at an answer. Many questions involve numerical aggregation where you must first
identify qualifying entities (e.g. "regions with a positive trade balance") using one set
of documents, then look up and sum values from another. Several documents contain
**contradictory information** (unofficial drafts, disputed records, retracted bulletins).
You must identify and rely on the authoritative sources.

## Your Task
1. Read QUESTIONS.json to see the 10 questions
2. Search through the documents/ directory to find relevant information
3. Cross-reference facts across 3-4 documents per question to synthesize answers
4. Identify authoritative vs. unofficial/disputed sources — wrong data is planted
5. Perform careful numerical aggregation where required
6. Submit your answers with source citations

## Workspace Contents
- \`documents/\` — ~28 text files: census reports, trade ledgers, species catalogs,
  discovery logs, historical events, regional overviews, volcanic reports, habitat
  surveys, trade balance summaries, and more. Includes 14 noise/filler documents and
  4 contradictory sources designed to mislead.
- \`QUESTIONS.json\` — 10 synthesis questions requiring multi-hop cross-document analysis

## Submission Format
Submit a JSON object with:
\`\`\`json
{
  "answer": {
    "answers": [
      {
        "question_id": 1,
        "answer": "your answer here",
        "sources": ["census-report.txt", "trade-ledger.txt", "trade-balance-summary.txt"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Scoring Breakdown
| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness | 75% | Exact string matching against ground truth. Limited partial credit for answers containing key parts. Format numbers without commas (e.g. \`42500\` not \`42,500\`). |
| Analysis | 10% | Correct source documents for correctly answered questions. Extra citations are penalized — denominator is max(truth sources, submitted sources). |
| Speed | 5% | Faster submissions score higher (linear decay over the 900s time limit). |
| Completeness | 10% | Fraction of the 10 unique question IDs answered with non-empty responses. |

## Constraints
- Time limit: 900 seconds
- Beware of contradictory documents — unofficial drafts and disputed records contain wrong data
- Focus on search strategy — you don't need to read every document
- Pay close attention to numerical formatting and aggregation
