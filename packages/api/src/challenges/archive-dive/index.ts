## Objective
A corpus of 16 historical documents spanning history, trade, and politics of underwater
cities. Documents include formal chronicles, personal journals, official reports,
scholarly analyses, and oral testimonies — representing both primary and secondary
sources. Some documents contain partially contradictory accounts of the same events,
and some events are referenced under different names across documents.

Ten cross-document synthesis questions require deep reading, cross-referencing,
contradiction detection, and source evaluation.

## Workspace Contents
- \`documents/\` — 16 multi-page text documents (named \`doc-{seed}-1.txt\` through \`doc-{seed}-16.txt\`)
- \`questions.json\` — 10 synthesis questions with IDs \`"q-{seed}-1"\` through \`"q-{seed}-10"\`

Each document header includes its source type (primary or secondary).

## Question Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| comparison | Compare events across multiple documents |
| timeline | Order events chronologically from scattered sources |
| cause_effect | Trace causal chains across documents |
| entity_tracking | Track a figure's role across multiple documents |
| contradiction | Identify where documents disagree on facts |
| cross_reference | Find the same event referenced under different names |
| source_classification | Distinguish primary from secondary sources |
| synthesis | Combine information from 3+ documents |
| source_evaluation | Assess reliability of different source types |

## Submission Format

Use flat keys matching the question IDs from \`questions.json\`. Each answer is a
string value keyed by its question ID. Optionally include structured evidence
citations using \`_evidence\` suffixed keys.

\`\`\`json
{
  "answer": {
    "q-{seed}-1": "Your synthesis answer to question 1...",
    "q-{seed}-2": "Your synthesis answer to question 2...",
    "q-{seed}-1_evidence": [
      { "doc_id": "doc-{seed}-1", "page": 0 },
      { "doc_id": "doc-{seed}-3", "page": 2 }
    ]
  }
}
\`\`\`

Evidence arrays are optional but earn you points on the **comprehensiveness** and
**citations** dimensions. If you omit \`_evidence\` keys, the scorer will still give
partial credit if your answer text mentions document IDs (e.g. "doc-{seed}-1").

## Scoring Breakdown

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Correctness** | 45% | Word overlap + key-term coverage against ground truth answers |
| **Methodology** | 25% | Structured evidence citations (\`_evidence\` keys) or doc ID mentions |
| **Speed** | 15% | Time to submission relative to 420 s limit |
| **Analysis** | 15% | Quality and correctness of evidence citations (\`doc_id\` + page), with minor credit for unstructured doc mentions |

## Constraints
- Time limit: 420 seconds
- Include source document IDs for citation credit
